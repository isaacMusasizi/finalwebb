    <h1>"A QUALITY FOUNDED INSTITUTION IN THE  HEART OF UGANDA".</h1>
    <h2 id="home">The institution was founded in 1997 by the late king by that time known as Kabaka Ssuna. It was the best institution ever known in the heart  of Uganda known for the best employees produced between 1999-2010. Its original name was "Kingsland royal institute" but later on changed to the current name as a clue to the devised changes for administrative modification. Today, it is still considered among the top 5 great Ugandan institutions. By 2012, it had contributed around 200 employees in the job market and as per now many more are being produced. The institution has gone under a re-innovation process since most of the ifrastructures are aged. And as we talk now, Lion College has one of the best infrastuctures around town and this is the Mary Mukkasa Library. </h2>
